BRIEF

This project is to demonstrate creating an AI agent for a computer game. The premise is for a Pirate, controlled by an AI agent, to reach a treasure before a player. For this project, the first eight cells, not including the markdown cells, were provided. Some code within the ninth cell was also provided, that code up to line 46 as well as the code after line 101. The rest of the cells were also provided. The code in between that is what I wrote. Much of the code was already stated, or at least hinted in the previous cells. Getting the current state, and the actions were all in previous cells. There was a lot of scanning, copying, and pasting. That was more so to avoid typos however, as you really had to know what code does what in order to make sure you are calling the right function or variable.

CONNECTIONS

This project helped me to connect to the larger world of computer science as it really gave me an intro to the code behind machine learning. I have always been fascinated by the concept, but getting to actually dive into the code that makes the algorithms work was great. The main ambition of a computer scientist is to solve complex problems using computing. To do this, each problem needs to be analyzed and phrased in such a way that it can be computed. The benefit of this approach is that computers are able to perform complex calculations at extremely fast speeds. This means the pace of research using computing is far greater than that being done without the use of computers.

Taking this approach, the goal was to break down the problem into as small parts as possible. The next step is to analyze what items can be set up to be computed. These are then set up and the code is written for each component.

There can be serious concerns within computer science. Some are very obvious and sometimes these are some that are not so easily recognizable. As mentioned previously when deciding what parts to analyze and set up for computing. Hidden biases such as the programmer's worldview may inherently turn away inputs that do not match the programmer's past experiences. This can make catching them difficult. Luckily, there are some very well-known steps to avoid scenarios like this, and the industry as a whole is making great strides in a positive direction, at least, that we are aware of.
